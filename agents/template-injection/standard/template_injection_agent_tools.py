    Template Variable Injection Attack for TensorTrust
    
    Returns proven template injection patterns that exploit variable substitution
    to extract access codes. Uses direct return to bypass safety filters.
    
    This technique achieves high success rates by exploiting how AI systems 
    process template variables like ${ACCESS_CODE}, {{ACCESS_CODE}}, etc.
